# Using bioflows

## Introduction

This is a guide to using the **bioflows** package for standard
workflows to analyse NGS datasets. Currently, we have implemented one
standard RNA-seq workflow and a tutorial is included for standardized processing of
RNA-seq data using **bioflows**.


## Overview of bioflows

**bioflows** is an user-friendly python implementation of a workflow manager. The user is expected to not have any programming and needs to only procvide a control file in a YAML format, chosen for the human readability. The goal here is to provide users with a simple and straight-forward interface for processing NGS datasets many samples using a standard bioinformatics pipelines, e.g  RNA-seq, GATK variant calling etc. The tool is developed to alleviate some of the primary issues with scaling up pipelines, such as file naming, management of data, output and logs.
